# SDET Technical Challenge

Take-Home Challenge

Time: 3 days | Stack: Playwright

---

## Overview

Develop an automated test suite covering API and Web UI testing using Playwright. This challenge evaluates your ability to create maintainable, reliable test automation that demonstrates technical depth and practical judgment.

---

## Target Applications

### API - Restful Booker

**Documentation:** https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html

### Web Interface - Automation in Testing

**URL:** https://automationintesting.online/

---

## Requirements

### API Tests

Minimum of 10 test cases covering:

- Success scenarios (happy paths)
- Negative scenarios (validation errors, edge cases)
- Multiple API endpoints
- Status code, schema, and data validation

### UI Tests

Minimum of 10 test cases covering:

- Success scenarios (critical user flows)
- Negative scenarios (form validation, error messages)
- Page element interactions
- Visual and behavioral assertions

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Test Planning

Clarity and justification of your test strategy, with focus on critical scenarios aligned with business impact.

### Test Coverage and Precision

Breadth of coverage and accuracy in verifying essential functionality, including error scenarios and critical flows.

### Code Quality

Code organization and maintainability, demonstrating best practices in test automation such as Page Object Model or Application Actions patterns.

### Tool Integration

Effective use of tools like Playwright, Docker, and GitHub Actions to ensure automation and consistency.

### Communication

Clarity and objectivity in the presentation video, including explanation of test strategy, challenges encountered, solutions applied, and improvement suggestions.

---

## Expected Practices

### Code Structure

- Use Page Objects or Application Actions to organize your code
- Avoid test dependencies
- Use descriptive names for tests and functions

### Code Quality

- Clean, well-organized code
- Comments where necessary
- Reusable functions and methods
- Clear and specific assertions

### Test Data Management

- Well-organized test data
- Use fixtures or helpers when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary hardcoded values

### Configuration

- Configure Playwright appropriately
- Configure timeouts and retries efficiently

---

## Deliverables

### 1. GitHub Repository

- Create a private GitHub repository
- Add collaborator access for user: **operationsvoidr**
- Include a complete README.md with:
  - Installation instructions
  - How to run the tests
  - Project structure
  - Test strategy and rationale behind test cases

### 2. Presentation Video

- Duration: maximum 5 minutes
- Record using tools like Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder
- Add the video link in the project README

---

## Final Presentation

After submitting your solution, you'll present your work in a 30-minute session with our CTO, Victor Buchalla.

**Schedule your presentation:** https://ro.am/buchalla/entrevista

During the presentation, you'll cover:

- Complete walkthrough of your solution
- Rationale behind technical decisions
- What you would improve given more time
- Deep understanding of how everything works, including any AI-generated code

Even if you used AI assistance, you must understand exactly how the generated code functions and be able to explain its operation in detail.

---

## Stretch Goals

These are optional but will be highly valued:

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tool configuration
- Automatic test execution on push/PR
- Automatic test report publishing

### Performance

- Parallel test execution
- Execution time optimization
- Efficient worker usage

### Additional

- Performance testing (API response time)
- Visual regression testing
- Test data management strategy
- Docker for execution environment

---

## Timeline

- **Duration:** 3 days from when you receive this challenge
- **Expected effort:** Focus on quality over quantity. Well-structured, organized tests that demonstrate technical reasoning are more valuable than extensive coverage.

---

## What We Value

Quality over quantity. Focus on creating well-structured, organized tests that demonstrate your technical reasoning and ability to make pragmatic decisions.

If you have questions or encounter technical issues with the test applications, reach out to us.
