## Challenge Components

### Part 1: Service as a Software Presentation (Written Deliverable)

Create a presentation about Service as a Software for an executive audience.

#### Scenario

You are a CX Analyst at Voidr and have been invited to present at an internal event for an enterprise client (e.g., CTO Summit at a major bank). Your presentation topic is:

> **"Why Service as a Software is revolutionizing how companies ensure the quality of their critical systems"**

Your audience:
- CTOs and VPs of Technology
- Directors of QA and Engineering
- Product Managers

#### Presentation Requirements

- **5 to 8 slides** (maximum)
- Must cover:
  - What is Service as a Software and how it differs from traditional SaaS
  - Why this matters for QA/Testing in mission-critical systems
  - Tangible benefits (efficiency, risk reduction, ROI)
  - An illustrative example or use case (can be fictional)

**Format:** Deliver as PDF or PPTX.

---

### Part 2: Executive Presentation + Customer Escalation (Video Deliverable)

Record a video (total **5-6 minutes**) with two parts.

#### Part 2A: Slides Presentation (~3 minutes)

Present your slides as if you were at the CTO Summit. Demonstrate:
- Clear explanation of technical concepts for executive audience
- Confident, engaging delivery
- Connection with the audience

#### Part 2B: Customer Escalation Response (~2 minutes)

Immediately after your presentation, respond to this scenario:

> The client's QA Director interrupts and says:
>
> *"Nice presentation, but I need to be honest: our new CTO is questioning all vendor contracts. He wants to see clear ROI in the next 30 days or he'll cancel. The technical team likes Voidr, but we can't prove value to him. What would you do?"*

We want to see how you:
- React under pressure
- Structure an action plan focused on customer outcomes
- Demonstrate empathy and customer-centric approach
- Navigate between technical value and business impact

#### Video Guidelines

- Record using Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder
- No professional editing needed — we want to see you communicating
- Show energy, confidence, and professionalism

---

### Part 3: AI Usage Documentation (Required)

You **must** use AI tools to complete this challenge. Document your AI usage in a separate section of your submission.

Include:

- **Which AI tools you used** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gamma, Beautiful.ai, Tome, Midjourney, etc.)
- **How you used AI** for:
  - Researching Service as a Software and the QA market
  - Creating and designing the presentation
  - Preparing your talking points
  - Any other aspect of the challenge
- **Example prompts** that were particularly effective
- **What you learned** about using AI for customer-facing work

We're evaluating your ability to leverage AI strategically, not avoid it.
