# Technical Account Manager Challenge

Take-Home Challenge

Time: 5 days | Role: Technical Account Manager

---

## About Voidr

**Voidr** is a Service as a Software solution designed for enterprise environments with mission-critical systems. It ensures high availability, reduces reputational and financial risks, and increases operational efficiency through intelligent test automation, fully managed by AI agents.

---

## The Challenge

We want to understand your ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and engagingly. In this challenge, you will:

1. **Research and understand** the concept of "Service as a Software" (SaaS 2.0) applied to the QA/Testing market
2. **Create a presentation** using AI tools
3. **Record a video** presenting to a fictional executive audience

> ⚠️ **Important:** The use of Artificial Intelligence is expected and encouraged at all stages of this challenge. At Voidr, AI is part of our daily routine — we want to see how you use it as a productivity tool to research, create, and refine your work.

---

## Context

You are a TAM at Voidr and have been invited to present at an internal event for an enterprise client (e.g., CTO Summit at a major bank). Your presentation topic is:

> **"Why Service as a Software is revolutionizing how companies ensure the quality of their critical systems"**

Your audience:
- CTOs and VPs of Technology
- Directors of QA and Engineering
- Product Managers

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (PDF or PPTX)

- **5 to 8 slides** (maximum)
- Must cover:
  - What is Service as a Software and how it differs from traditional SaaS
  - Why this matters for QA/Testing in mission-critical systems
  - Tangible benefits (efficiency, risk reduction, ROI)
  - An illustrative example or use case (can be fictional)
- **Requirement:** Use AI tools to create and improve the presentation (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gamma, Beautiful.ai, Tome, Midjourney, etc.). This is expected and part of the evaluation.

### 2. Presentation Video (two parts)

- **Total: 5 minutes** (minimum 4, maximum 6)
- You can use Loom, recorded Zoom, or any tool
- No professional editing needed — we want to see you communicating

| Part | Duration | What to Present |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Part 1** | ~3 min | Slides presentation about Service as a Software |
| **Part 2** | ~2 min | Response to the crisis scenario below |

#### 🚨 Crisis Scenario (Part 2)

> Imagine that at the end of your presentation, the client's QA Director interrupts you and says:
>
> *"Nice presentation, but I need to be honest: our new CTO is questioning all vendor contracts. He wants to see clear ROI in the next 30 days or he'll cancel. The technical team likes Voidr, but we can't prove value to him. What would you do?"*

Record your response to this scenario in up to 2 minutes. We want to see how you:
- React under pressure
- Structure an action plan
- Demonstrate empathy and consultative approach

### 3. Personal README

A brief document (can be in the same repository or a separate .md file) containing:
- Which AI tools you used and how (we want to understand your process!)
- What you learned about Service as a Software
- A reflection: how would you use this knowledge in conversations with Voidr clients?

- [The Rise of Service as a Software](https://a16z.com/service-as-software/) - Andreessen Horowitz
- Articles about AI-first companies and vertical SaaS
- QA/Testing automation cases (Mabl, Testim, etc.)
