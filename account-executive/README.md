#### Target Account: NeoBank Digital

**Company Profile:**

- Expanding to Mexico and Colombia in 2026

- Recent incident: production bug caused $500K in losses

Your deal strategy document must include:

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Account Overview** | Your analysis of NeoBank's situation, priorities, and why now is the right time to buy |
| **Stakeholder Map** | Key decision-makers and influencers (create realistic personas with titles, motivations, and concerns) |
| **Pain Points Analysis** | Specific problems you'd address and how Voidr solves each one |
| **Competitive Landscape** | Alternatives NeoBank might consider (build vs. buy, competitors) and your differentiation strategy |
| **Deal Strategy** | Timeline, key milestones, and tactics to advance the deal from POC to close |
| **Proposal Structure** | High-level scope, investment range, and ROI calculation |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Top 5 objections you expect and how you'd handle each |

You're in a closing meeting with NeoBank's leadership after a successful 30-day POC. Attendees:
- **CTO** - Technical decision-maker, concerned about integration and engineering overhead

- **CFO** - Joined to evaluate the investment, focused on ROI and cost justification

3. **Business Case & ROI**
   - Financial justification for the investment
   - Cost of inaction / status quo
   - Timeline to value

4. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - Why Voidr vs. alternatives
   - Address the "build vs. buy" question

5. **Close**
   - Handle a pricing objection (simulate CFO pushback)
   - Propose clear next steps
   - Ask for the business

#### Video Guidelines

- Record using Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder
